    <h1>Welcome to Hello Skyy. We are glad you found us.</h1>

<p>The purpose of Hello Skyy is To provide a central hub, on decentralized infrastructure, to educate, document, and assemble the information, tools, and collaborative development space needed, as we explore an alternative to the crippling control over people that big tech companies employ as a lucrative business model. We want to offer an alternative to big tech, and teach people how to choose freedom and privacy over convenience by exploring web3, blockchain, decentralization, and open source technologies.</p>
